problem 1:

link to the basic sum

you dont have to take any inputs . inputs are taken for you.
function template is also provided .
just take the values a & b,  add them , return the answer.

if you dont know about functions, here is the part. skip it if you like.
functions -> i wont give any formal definitions here. functions are basically parts of code that you may want to use again . you write a function and pass different values to it . so , no need to write another code for same funcitonality .  a function returns a value that must be caught (more on this later).

scenario 1: you are given a pair of numbers , add them , print the answer.

code:
a=2     
b=3
result =a+b
print(result)

scene 2:
now suppose , you are given 10 such pairs. it will not be feasible to write result =a+b;print(result)
for each one of them .
functions come into play here.

def word in python indicates the following code is a function.

so lets write a function named add that takes ANY  2 values ,adds them and returns them . theres a difference between returning a value and printing a value. values that a function returns must be caught in a variable.

so back to our function:

def add(a,b):
    result=a+b
    return result

thats it.
now if we want the answer of sum of 4 and 5,
we can use the function as:

returned_value_1 = add(4,5)
returned_value_2 = add(9,11)

the variable returned_value holds the answer that add(4,5) returned.
